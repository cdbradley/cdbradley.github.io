title: Programming: Baptism by Fire
---
Hello! My name's Colt Bradley, I'm a student of Physics and Mathematics at NCSU and I don't really know what I want to do with my life. Enter this project. 

Right now, I'm hoping to use this as a way to learn programming and a variety of skills that I'll outline in posts at some point (Once I figure out how to work this site). I plan to use it as a sort of baptism by fire/build the plane while flying it type of project. We'll see how it goes. 

Anyways, if you have any suggestions please [email](mailto:coltbradley@gmail.com) me or if you want to connect personally or professionally, send me a request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltbradley). Excited to be starting this. 

To see how I created this site, see [this](http://roymoran.me/personal-blog-setup-guide) guide. Also, [here's](http://blog.woodylabs.com/2012/01/1and1-web-hosting-git-installing-it-for-singular-dev/) one for me to set it up on my 1&1 domain [cdbradley.com](https://www.cdbradley.com)(currently redirects to this site).
